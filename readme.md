Imagine you notice a mac laptop out in the open. Though you have your pineapple at the ready the target is not connecting to it. Its time to make them connect to it forcefully. With this payload you'll be able to force the target to join your WiFi.

How To Set Up:

Hi there PuggosTheDuck here welcome to my program there are two ways of using my program either selecting Mac or Windows in the payload.txt file. If you chose Mac then just fill in the text prompts I give you in the file. For windows though it's a little more complicated. First rename the XML file to what the name of the fake Wi-Fi is called. Then fill in the prompts on the XML file. Then fill in the prompts on the payload txt file for the Windows section.

Thank you and have fun eating bread I___( o)>
